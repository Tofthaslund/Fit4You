# Known Bugs
Webhooks from Stripe are not working, this is despite payments being sent to Stripe without issue. Many attempts to resolve this issue, including contacting Code Institute tutor support were made, to no avail. Error code - 405 (Method Not Allowed) remains.

# Development Issues

## Deployment
-   An attempt was made to use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to store and serve static and media files and though this started out successfully, data limits for the free account were somehow reached after only 3 days of hosting and so I decided to roll back and try another method to serve these files, for fear of the cost involved getting too high.
-   WhiteNoise is used instead. [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/index.html)
-   This worked in development mode (with debug on) but as soon as I switched to production mode (debug off), media files were no longer served and had to be copied manually into the new 'staticfiles' folder that was created to run 'collectstatic'.
-   Whitenoise unfortunately is not suitable for serving user-uploaded “media” files. it only checks for static files at startup and so files added after the app starts won’t be seen - in the case of this project that would mean images connected to admin adding a new program or blog post.
-   Also, serving user-uploaded files from the same domain as your main application can be a security risk so with these in mind, if this project were to go into 'actual' production, AWS (or similar) would have to be used and the costs involved acquired.
-   Many edits, commits and pushes were made in trying to solve this problem and keep access to both environments working (mainly from the beginning of February). Eventually I got the site deployed securely and with debug off, but the uploading of images for admin issue still remains.


# Code Validators

## [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Used to validate HTML code. The following non-critical errors were found;
-   Error: Bad value icon for attribute type on element link: Subtype missing.
-   Error: Element li not allowed as child of element nav in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
-   Error: Duplicate ID user-options.
-   Error: Element li not allowed as child of element nav in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
-   Warning: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.
-   Error: The aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document.

## [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
Used to validate CSS code. The following non-critical errors were found, as well as various non-critical warnings.
-   abbr[data-original-title], abbr[title] - Property text-decoration-skip-ink doesn't exist : none
-   .toast - Property backdrop-filter doesn't exist : blur(10px)

## [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
Used to analyse and validate Python code during development.

## [JSLint](https://jslint.com)
All .js files were checked. No issues were found on the JSON files. The stripe_elements .js file was requested to use double quotes instead of single quotes. The countryfield .js file had same request with some undeclared '$' and unexpected 'this' also.

## [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
All .py files were checked using Flake8 in the terminal. There are still several 'null=True' and 'line too long' issues, but nothing critical.

    -   iPhone 7 Plus (Phone)
    -   Dell Inspiron 15 (Laptop)
